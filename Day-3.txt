 view:- 
A view is a logical table based on a table or another view.
a view contains no data of it's own .
the table on which the view is based is known as base table.

advantage :-
1)views restrict access to data because the view can display selective columns from the table.
2)views can be used to make simple queries to retrieve the results of complicated queries.
3)one view can be used to retrieve data from several tables.

simple view:-
1)Derives data from only one table.
2)contains no functions or groupby data.
3)can perform DML(data manupulation language insert,update,delete) operation

complex view:-
1)derives data from many table.
2)contains functions or group by data.
3)doesnot always allow DML operations.

example:-

1)create view xyz as select empno,ename from emp where deptno=10;
-------------------------------------------
complex view

create table employee (empno number primary key,name varchar2(20) not null,salary number(9,2),address varchar2(30));

insert into employee values(104,'peter','30000','bangalore');
delete from employee where empno=101;//delete the record from child then we can delete from parent.
select * from employee;
create table loc(empno number references employee,loc varchar2(30));
insert into loc values(104,'India');
select * from loc;

join
----------------------------
inner or equijoins :- in this type of join one column should be common in both the tables and they should have parent and child relation ship.
----------------------------
select a.empno,a.name,a.salary,a.address,b.loc from employee a,loc b where a.empno=b.empno;

view
------
create view tabs as select a.empno,a.name,a.salary,a.address,b.loc from employee a,loc b where a.empno=b.empno;
